# Advent of code 2023

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by Eric Wastl. Each year, starting on December 1st, an advent calendar of daily programming puzzles begins. Each puzzle is unlocked at midnight (EST/UTC-5).

## Langs (so far) I've used to solve the AOC puzzles:

day[1..5, 9..11] - [Go](https://go.dev)

day[6..8, 12..] - [Nim](https://nim-lang.org)
